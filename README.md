# Bank_Customer_churn_prediction
Aim of this project is to identify and visualize which factors contribute to customer churn.
We will build a prediction model that will classify if a customer is going to churn or not.
Preferably and based on model performance, choose a model that will attach a probability to the churn to make it easier for customer service to target low hanging fruits in their efforts to prevent churn.
